# Data: Unstructured Meetup

Welcome to the home of the **Data: Unstructured** meetup group based in Chicago! üèôÔ∏è

## About Us

We are a community of data professionals who want to share our expertise and experience with one another so we can build the best data systems possible. Our meetings are held in a casual, open discussion format based on an agenda we crowdsource ahead of each session.

## How We Meet

- **Format**: Casual, open discussion
- **Agenda**: Community-driven and crowdsourced
- **Location**: Chicago (usually a coffee shop)
- **Focus**: Building better data systems through shared knowledge

## Contributing to Meeting Agendas

We believe the best meetings come from community input! Here's how you can contribute:

1. **Browse upcoming meetings** in the [`agendas/`](./agendas/) directory
2. **Propose agenda items** by opening a Pull Request with your suggested topics
3. **Join the discussion** by commenting on existing agenda items

Each meeting has its own markdown file in the `agendas/` directory, named by date (e.g., `2025-08-05.md`).

## Getting Started
